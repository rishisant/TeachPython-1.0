# TeachPython-1.0
Learn how to code Python!

This project was started on September 7th, 2020.

I want to learn more about Python, and I figured that teaching others would be the best way to do so!

I started this project to help people code in Python and become more comfortable. Hopefully you enjoy if you are a beginner, and for
seasoned Python vets, let me know how I did with teaching some Python! 

I don't know when I'll be done with this project, but I am excited to pursue it!

Take care, everybody, and happy coding!
